## Note 
When using Windows, ensure to use the ` if __name__ == "__main__": ` guard to ensure that the code which starts new processes only runs when the script is executed directly, preventing child processes from re-importing the main module and causing a RuntimeError related to Python’s multiprocessing bootstrapping phase.
