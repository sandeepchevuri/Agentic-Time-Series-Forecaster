### Features

* **Google's TimesFM 2.5 foundational model**: [TimesFM 2.5](https://github.com/google-research/timesfm) has been added to the foundational models hub. Refer to [#224](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/224) for more details.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from timecopilot.models.foundation.timesfm import TimesFM

    df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://timecopilot.s3.amazonaws.com/public/data/events_pageviews.csv",
        parse_dates=["ds"],
    )
    model = TimesFM(repo_id="google/timesfm-2.5-200m-pytorch")
    fcst = model.forecast(df, h=12)
    print(fcst)
    ```

* **Improved agent prompt**: Enhanced the agent prompt for better performance and accuracy. See [#218](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/218).

### Fixes

* **Correct pydantic-ai library**: Fixed the pydantic-ai library dependency to ensure proper functionality. See [#221](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/221).

* **TimesFM quantiles**: Fixed quantile handling for TimesFM models to ensure correct probabilistic forecasts. See [#225](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/225).

### Documentation

* **Time series foundation models comparison example**: Added comprehensive example on how to compare time series foundational models. See [#227](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/227).

* **Revamped static site**: Major improvements to the static documentation site with better design and navigation. See [#226](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/226).

### Infrastructure

* **Documentation tests across Python versions**: Added testing for documentation examples across multiple Python versions to ensure compatibility. See [#220](https://github.com/TimeCopilot/timecopilot/pull/220).
